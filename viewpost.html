                    <p>
                        anny Boyle has confirmed that he's directing the next James Bond film.

                        The movie, the 25th in the franchise, will be actor Daniel Craig 's last outing as secret agent 007.


                        Director Danny revealed he's going to be at the helm for the movie at a screening of his FX show Trust at New York's Florence Gould Hall Theater on Wednesday night.

                        After being asked about the rumours he was going to be directing the film, Danny said: "We are working on a script right now. And it all depends on that really. I am working on a Richard Curtis script at the moment. We hope to start shooting that in six or seven weeks. Then Bond would be right at the end of the year. But we are working on them both right now."
                        He added to Metro that he and John Hodge, who he previously worked with on Trainspotting and The Beach, were expanding on an idea they had for the famous character.

                        He said: "Weâ€™ve got an idea, John Hodge, the screenwriter, and I have got this idea, and John is writing it at the moment. And it all depends on how it turns out. It would be foolish of me to give any of it away."

                        Slumdog Millionaire writer Simon Beaufoy, who works with Danny on Trust, told the paper he thought his pal was the perfect choice.
